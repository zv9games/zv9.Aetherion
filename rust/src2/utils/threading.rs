//! ðŸ§µ Threading Module
//! Provides safe concurrency utilities for EchoEngine.
//!
//! Used for async audit logging, overlay rendering, and generator tasks.
//! Designed to support backend thread separation and echo processing without blocking the host thread.
//!
//! Contributors may use `EchoQueue` to dispatch messages to background workers safely.
