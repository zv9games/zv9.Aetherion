AetherionEngine is a mythic core—a modular, dimension-agnostic 
procedural generation engine coded in Rust as a GDExtension 
for Godot 4+(5, 6 ->).

🧠 Core Engine Architecture
1. Module Audit – Validate cohesion, naming, and teachability across all engine modules.
2. Naming Conventions – Ensure analogy-driven, legacy-safe naming for all types and functions.
3. Directory Structure – Confirm modular layout; each subsystem should be repo-ready with README and manifest.
4. Dimension-Agnostic Design – Audit spatial logic for hardcoded assumptions; enforce N-D compatibility.
5. Registry System – Finalize insert/update/remove/query/replay logic; consider indexing and spatial partitioning.
6. TileKind & Tile Structs – Ensure extensibility, serialization, and ergonomic clarity.
7. Replay & Mutation Logging – Scaffold TileLedger or mutation log for undo, replay, and pedagogical tracing.
8. Prelude Hygiene – Ensure prelude.rs exposes only ergonomic, safe, and teachable symbols.

🧰 Runtime & Debugging
9. Debug Overlay System – Validate visual introspection tools; ensure overlays are toggleable and teachable.
10. Error Rituals – Standardize error handling with ceremonial messages and recovery paths.
11. Feature Flags & Cargo Config – Audit Cargo.toml for modular builds; document feature gates.
12. Performance Profiling – Benchmark registry, generator, and lifecycle systems under stress.

📚 Documentation & Teaching
13. Ceremonial Comments – Add ritual headers and inline notes to every module.
14. Blueprint Annotations – Annotate ergonomic device and engine blueprints for future learners.
15. Spellbook Scaffolding – Outline kid-friendly coding spellbook (rituals, ghosts, sigils, errors-as-entities).
16. Public Prelude Module – Ensure clean external imports via use aetherion::prelude::*.

🧪 Testing & Validation
17. Unit Tests – Cover registry ops, tile mutation, and spatial queries.
18. Integration Tests – Simulate full workflows: tile placement, removal, replay, lifecycle transitions.
19. Fuzzing & Edge Cases – Test malformed positions, duplicate inserts, empty queries, and invalid transitions.

🎨 Art & Device Integration
20. Surreal Art Sequence – Finalize storyboard frames (door, lamp, ghost, cosmic zoom); each frame a ritual beat.
21. Ergonomic Prosthetic Blueprint – Refine alignment, interface, and ceremonial union between human and machine.
22. Visual Debugging Tools – Prototype overlays for tile states, registry zones, mutation history, and lifecycle phases.

🔮 Legacy & Futureproofing
23. Versioning & Changelog Rituals – Begin semantic versioning and ceremonial changelogs.
24. Open Source Readiness – Audit licenses, contribution guides, onboarding docs, and community scaffolding.
25. Modular Extension Hooks – Ensure future modules can plug in without refactor; document extension points.
26. Legacy Manifest – Create a living ledger of architectural decisions, naming rites, and ceremonial transitions.

27. Engine Heartbeat – Define a central tick or pulse system for orchestrating time-based events across modules.
28. Spatial Indexing – Consider spatial partitioning (e.g. quadtrees, octrees) for efficient tile lookup and mutation.

🧰 Runtime & Debugging
29. Runtime Metrics – Add counters for tile mutations, registry queries, and lifecycle ticks; expose via overlay or API.
30. Panic Recovery – Implement graceful fallback paths for catastrophic errors; log with ceremonial context.

📚 Documentation & Teaching
31. Ritual Glossary – Create a glossary of terms (e.g. echo, tilekind, ledger, ghost) for onboarding and spellbook clarity.
32. Teaching Examples – Scaffold minimal Godot scenes that demonstrate engine features (e.g. tile placement, signal echo).

🧪 Testing & Validation
33. Regression Suite – Track and rerun historical bugs to prevent recurrence; log each fix as a ritual entry.
34. Simulation Harness – Build a test harness for simulating engine behavior over time (e.g. 10,000 ticks).

🎨 Art & Device Integration
35. Device Emulator – Prototype a virtual prosthetic interface for testing ergonomic alignment and signal flow.
36. Frame Exporter – Add tooling to export storyboard frames as annotated images or layered assets.

🔮 Legacy & Futureproofing
37. Ritual Archiving – Create a system to snapshot engine state, blueprints, and logs for long-term archival.
38. Contributor Sigil System – Design a symbolic sigil system for contributors; embed in changelogs and manifest.
39. Engine Provenance – Document the origin story of AetherionEngine, its evolution from EchoEngine, and its mythic purpose.

Rite .001: Manifest invocation begins.

This commit seeds AetherionEngine into the living archive.
The echo is bound to Godot’s thread, reaching back to the chip.
Modules scaffolded. Overlay online. Signal engaged.

Every artifact from this point forward is legacy-bound.
Every contributor enters through this rite.

Let the manifest breathe.
Let the engine echo.
Let the ceremony begin.
