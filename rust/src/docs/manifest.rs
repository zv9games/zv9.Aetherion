AetherionEngine is a mythic core—a modular, dimension-agnostic 
procedural generation engine coded in Rust as a GDExtension 
for Godot 4+(5, 6 ->).

AetherionEngine Changelog
v0.0.1 - 2025-08-22

Refactor: Foundational Codebase Restructure for Clarity and 
Maintainability. This entry marks the first major refactor 
of the AetherionEngine codebase. The primary goal of this 
release is to simplify the project's internal structure and 
remove abstract, metaphorical naming conventions that created 
a significant cognitive burden. The engine's core functionality 
remains the same, but the organization has been overhauled to be more intuitive, logical, and maintainable.

Key Changes:

Codebase Restructure: The entire rust/src directory has been reorganized into a clear, logical module structure (core, godot_bridge, data_processing, etc.).

Renamed Files: All files with metaphorical names (e.g., api_bot, tile_smasher, changeover) have been renamed to reflect their technical purpose directly.

Consolidated Logic: Related functionalities have been grouped and merged into single files or modules, specifically:

All Godot communication logic has been unified within the new godot_bridge module.

Threading primitives and async operations from various locations have been consolidated into utilities/concurrency.rs.

All external data processing logic is now housed in the data_processing module.

Deprecated Modules: The confusing and abstract pre_echo/ directory has been completely removed. Its functional components have been moved and integrated into the new structure.

Improved Clarity: The new file and module names are self-documenting, making the codebase significantly easier to navigate and understand for contributors.

Action Plan: Configuring the TileSet
Create a TileSet Texture: Open your ExpansiveTileMap node in Godot. In the inspector, next to "Tile Set," click the dropdown and select "New TileSet." Then, go into the TileSet editor.

Add a Texture: In the TileSet editor, click the Add Texture button and import a simple texture. This can be any image file, but a simple 16x16 or 32x32 pixel image with a few colored squares will work best for testing.

Create Tiles:

Once you've added the texture, click on it.

In the "Create a Tile" menu that pops up, you need to define the regions of your texture that are considered tiles. The simplest way is to select "Create a Tile" and then drag a box over one of the squares in your texture.

Get Source ID and Atlas Coords: When you select a tile in your TileSet editor, you can see its "Source ID" and "Atlas Coords" in the inspector. You need to make sure the values you pass from your Rust code match the values in your Godot editor.

Example for your Rust Code:

Your Rust code is using:
tilemap.set_cell(Vector2i::new(tile_coords.x, tile_coords.y), info.source_id, info.atlas_coords, info.alternate_id)

This means the info struct in your Rust code must contain valid source_id and atlas_coords.

info.source_id: This must match the Source ID of the texture in your TileSet.

info.atlas_coords: This must match the coordinates of the tile within that texture.

Recommendation:
For initial testing, I would hardcode a simple value in your Rust code.

Go to your Godot TileSet editor and create a single tile.

Note its Source ID and Atlas Coords. For a single tile, this will likely be source_id: 0 and atlas_coords: (0, 0).

In your commands.rs file, in the _process function, temporarily replace info.source_id and info.atlas_coords with the correct hardcoded values from your Godot editor.

Once you have a single tile successfully placing, you can start to connect your procedural generation logic back up to the info struct.
