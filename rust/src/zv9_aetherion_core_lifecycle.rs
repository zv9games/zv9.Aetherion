// âœ… Suggestions for aetherion/core/lifecycle.rs

// ðŸ”§ Add intermediate states if needed:
//     - Paused: for gameplay freeze or menu overlays
//     - Error: for unrecoverable runtime faults
//     - Restarting: for hot reload or engine reset

// ðŸ§© Consider adding timestamps or durations:
//     - Track when each state was entered
//     - Useful for diagnostics, profiling, or analytics

// ðŸš¦ Add transition validation:
//     - Prevent invalid transitions (e.g. Terminated â†’ Running)
//     - Consider a method like `can_transition_to(target: LifecycleState) -> bool`

// ðŸ“¡ Integrate with signal system:
//     - Emit signals on state changes (already commented)
//     - Could hook into AetherionSignals or RuntimeState

// ðŸ§ª Add unit tests:
//     - Validate state transitions
//     - Ensure lifecycle behaves predictably under edge cases

// ðŸ§¼ Optional: Add display or logging helpers:
//     - `fn status_string(&self) -> &str`
//     - `fn log_transition(&self, from: LifecycleState, to: LifecycleState)`

// ðŸš€ Future: Add lifecycle hooks or callbacks:
//     - `on_initialize`, `on_shutdown`, etc.
//     - Useful for modular subsystems or plugin architecture



// Manages engine startup, shutdown, and lifecycle transitions.
// Tracks the current state and provides hooks for signal dispatch and diagnostics.

// Represents the current lifecycle state of the engine.
